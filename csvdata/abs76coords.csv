Electrons trapped in the wake can be accelerated to high energy. Existing glass lasers of power density 10 18 W/cm 2 shone on plasmas of densities 10 18 cm− 3 can yield gigaelectronvolts of electron energy per centimeter of acceleration distance. This acceleration mechanism is demonstrated through computer simulation.

The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of 10 18 W∕ cm 2, lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt.

Recently, one of the actively researched areas lies in the additive manufacturing of smart materials and structures. Smart materials are those materials that have the ability to change their shape or properties under the influence of external stimuli. With the introduction of smart materials, the AM-fabricated components are able to alter their shape or properties over time (the 4th dimension) as a response to the applied external stimuli.

We use plant‐level data and exploit a unique feature of corporate law that allows us to deal with possible biases associated with the timing of the laws. We find that when managers are insulated from takeovers, worker wages (especially those of white‐collar workers) rise. The destruction of old plants falls, but the creation of new plants also falls.

A similar problem arises in radar because of the need for short, yet energetic pulses, without having circuits capable of handling the required peak powers. The solution for radar transmission is to stretch the pulse by passing it through a positively dispersive delay line before amplifying and transmitting the pulse. The echo is compressed to its original pulse shape by a negatively dispersive delay line [11. We wish to report here a system which transposes the technique employed in radar to the optical regime, and that in principle should be capable of producing short (sl ps) pulses with energies at the Joule level. A long pulse is deliberately produced by stretching a short, lowenergy pulse in a single mode optical fiber. The pulse is linearly chirped in the fiber by the combination of group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation [2]. The stretched pulse is amplified and then compressed by a double grating compressor [3]. Amplifying the stretched pulse rather than the compressed pulse allows for higher energies to be achieved before self-focusing occurs. The amplification does not appear to affect the chirp linearity and so the pulses can be fully compressed [4]. A potential benefit of amplifying a chirped pulse in an inhomogeneous medium is gain sweeping.

It was here that Bronislaw Malinowski conducted the path-breaking fieldwork that enabled him to revolutionize British social anthropology. And it was here that he developed one of anthropology's most important tools: photography. Malinowski's Kiriwina presents nearly two hundred of Malinowski's previously unpublished photographs, taken between 1915 and 1918, of the Trobriand Islanders. The images are more than embellishments of his ethnography; they are a recreation in striking detail of a distant world. Michael Young, an anthropologist and Malinowski's authorized biographer, has selected the photographs based on one of Malinowski's unpublished studies of the region, and the plan of that abandoned project has helped structure this book. Divided into fourteen sections, Malinowski's Kiriwina is a series of linked photo-essays based on Trobriand institutions and cultural themes as described by Malinowski. The introductory essay by Young appraises the founding anthropologist's photographic oeuvre, explains the historical circumstances and technical aspects of the images, and puts them in their colonial context. Young illuminates the photographs with quotations from Malinowski's diaries, letters, and field notes, thereby giving a biographical dimension to the collection. Commentaries on the images by contemporary Trobrianders add a further layer of interpretation. The result is a stunning record not only of a fascinating place, but of the mutual relationship between ethnography and the visual.",,,1998,,Malinowski's Kiriwina: fieldwork photography 1915-1918,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WCyRadVFP94C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:GR7uEpx9KVIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=hOB7epewWm&sig=EtAnsbj95Tm_es8Dxq5vifGZv9A,Michael W Young and Bronislaw Malinowski,"['Michael W Young', 'Bronislaw Malinowski']",,,,University of Chicago Press,,citations,oYfxmfYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,"{1999: 3, 2000: 2, 2001: 6, 2002: 3, 2003: 5, 2004: 7, 2005: 13, 2006: 6, 2007: 4, 2008: 4, 2009: 9, 2010: 4, 2011: 10, 2012: 6, 2013: 7, 2014: 9, 2015: 7, 2016: 12, 2017: 6, 2018: 6, 2019: 7, 2020: 2}",3oung2,3oung,0,medicine,54.6943473815918,-80.07057189941406

Because of capital market imperfections, poor agents choose working for a wage over self-employment, and wealthy agents become entrepreneurs who monitor workers. Only with sufficient inequality, however, will there be employment contracts; otherwise, there is either subsistence or self-employment. Thus, in static equilibrium, the occupational structure depends on distribution. Since the latter is itself endogenous, we demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model dynamically and studying examples in which initial wealth distributions have long-run effects.

A number of recent data sets and a body of new research allow us to start building an image of the way the extremely poor live their lives. Our discussion builds on household surveys conducted in 13 countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and Timor Leste (East Timor). These surveys provide detailed information on extremely poor households around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, including information on what they consume, where they work, and how they save and borrow. We consider the extremely poor—those living in households where the consumption per capita is less than $1.08 per person per day—as well as the merely “poor”—defined as those who live under $2.16 a day—using 1993 purchasing power parity as benchmark.
