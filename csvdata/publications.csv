Work based on these principles, supervised by the Poverty Action Lab, is being carried out in dozens of countries. Drawing on this and their 15 years of research from Chile to India, Kenya to Indonesia, they have identified wholly new aspects of the behavior of poor people, their needs, and the way that aid or financial investment can affect their lives. Their work defies certain presumptions: that microfinance is a cure-all, that schooling equals learning, that poverty at the level of 99 cents a day is just a more extreme version of the experience any of us have when our income falls uncomfortably low. This important book illuminates how the poor live, and offers all of us an opportunity to think of a world beyond poverty.

A similar problem arises in radar because of the need for short, yet energetic pulses, without having circuits capable of handling the required peak powers. The solution for radar transmission is to stretch the pulse by passing it through a positively dispersive delay line before amplifying and transmitting the pulse. The echo is compressed to its original pulse shape by a negatively dispersive delay line [11. We wish to report here a system which transposes the technique employed in radar to the optical regime, and that in principle should be capable of producing short (sl ps) pulses with energies at the Joule level. A long pulse is deliberately produced by stretching a short, lowenergy pulse in a single mode optical fiber. The pulse is linearly chirped in the fiber by the combination of group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation [2]. The stretched pulse is amplified and then compressed by a double grating compressor [3]. Amplifying the stretched pulse rather than the compressed pulse allows for higher energies to be achieved before self-focusing occurs. The amplification does not appear to affect the chirp linearity and so the pulses can be fully compressed [4]. A potential benefit of amplifying a chirped pulse in an inhomogeneous medium is gain sweeping.

Malinowski's Kiriwina presents nearly two hundred of Malinowski's previously unpublished photographs, taken between 1915 and 1918, of the Trobriand Islanders. The images are more than embellishments of his ethnography; they are a recreation in striking detail of a distant world. Michael Young, an anthropologist and Malinowski's authorized biographer, has selected the photographs based on one of Malinowski's unpublished studies of the region, and the plan of that abandoned project has helped structure this book. Divided into fourteen sections, Malinowski's Kiriwina is a series of linked photo-essays based on Trobriand institutions and cultural themes as described by Malinowski. The introductory essay by Young appraises the founding anthropologist's photographic oeuvre, explains the historical circumstances and technical aspects of the images, and puts them in their colonial context. Young illuminates the photographs with quotations from Malinowski's diaries, letters, and field notes, thereby giving a biographical dimension to the collection. Commentaries on the images by contemporary Trobrianders add a further layer of interpretation.

Because of capital market imperfections, poor agents choose working for a wage over self-employment, and wealthy agents become entrepreneurs who monitor workers. Only with sufficient inequality, however, will there be employment contracts; otherwise, there is either subsistence or self-employment. Thus, in static equilibrium, the occupational structure depends on distribution. Since the latter is itself endogenous, we demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model dynamically and studying examples in which initial wealth distributions have long-run effects.

Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials in development economics. Work based on these principles, supervised by the Poverty Action Lab, is being carried out in dozens of countries. Drawing on this and their 15 years of research from Chile to India, Kenya to Indonesia, they have identified wholly new aspects of the behavior of poor people, their needs, and the way that aid or financial investment can affect their lives.
