Electrons trapped in the wake can be accelerated to high energy. Existing glass lasers of power density 10 18 W/cm 2 shone on plasmas of densities 10 18 cm− 3 can yield gigaelectronvolts of electron energy per centimeter of acceleration distance. This acceleration mechanism is demonstrated through computer simulation.

The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of 10 18 W∕ cm 2, lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt. A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the direction of laser propagation.

Smart materials are those materials that have the ability to change their shape or properties under the influence of external stimuli. With the introduction of smart materials, the AM-fabricated components are able to alter their shape or properties over time (the 4th dimension) as a response to the applied external stimuli.

The neurobiological mechanism underlying this alteration remains unclear. We hypothesize that the transfer of dopamine release from reward to reward-predicting cues, as normally observed in animal studies, may be deficient in ADHD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate striatal responses to reward-predicting cues and reward delivery in a classical conditioning paradigm. Data from 14 high-functioning and stimulant-naïve young adults with elevated lifetime symptoms of ADHD (8 males, 6 females) and 15 well-matched controls (8 males, 7 females) were included in the analyses. During reward anticipation, increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the right ventral and left dorsal striatum were observed in controls, but not in the ADHD group. The opposite pattern was observed in response to reward delivery; the ADHD group demonstrated significantly greater BOLD responses in the ventral striatum bilaterally and the left dorsal striatum relative to controls. In the ADHD group, the number of current hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms was inversely related to ventral striatal responses during reward anticipation and positively associated with responses to reward. The BOLD response patterns observed in the striatum are consistent with impaired predictive dopamine signaling in ADHD, which may explain altered reward-contingent behaviors and symptoms of ADHD.",,,2014,,Abnormal striatal BOLD responses to reward anticipation and reward delivery in ADHD,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089129,Emi Furukawa and Patricia Bado and Gail Tripp and Paulo Mattos and Jeff R Wickens and Ivanei E Bramati and Brent Alsop and Fernanda Meireles Ferreira and Debora Lima and Fernanda Tovar-Moll and Joseph A Sergeant and Jorge Moll,"['Emi Furukawa', 'Patricia Bado', 'Gail Tripp', 'Paulo Mattos', 'Jeff R Wickens', 'Ivanei E Bramati', 'Brent Alsop', 'Fernanda Meireles Ferreira', 'Debora Lima', 'Fernanda Tovar-Moll', 'Joseph A Sergeant', 'Jorge Moll']",PloS one,9,2,Public Library of Science,e89129,citations,pkpL0JQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,"{2014: 3, 2015: 8, 2016: 12, 2017: 9, 2018: 12, 2019: 14, 2020: 12}",1Bado0

But what goals would managers pursue? This paper uses variation in corporate governance generated by state adoption of antitakeover laws to empirically map out managerial preferences. We use plant‐level data and exploit a unique feature of corporate law that allows us to deal with possible biases associated with the timing of the laws. We find that when managers are insulated from takeovers, worker wages (especially those of white‐collar workers) rise. The destruction of old plants falls, but the creation of new plants also falls. Finally, overall productivity and profitability decline in response to these laws.
